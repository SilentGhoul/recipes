Description
This classic chocolate pound cake is moist, soft and delicious with a tender crumb. A simple recipe that takes just 10 minutes to prepare and 40 minutes to bake. Absolutely delicious on its own but can be accompanied with so much more such as whipped cream, fresh fruits, and glazes. Today I give it a little more lightness by whipping the eggs and adding some milk.
